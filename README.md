# Alcohol based Rocket Launcher
In this project, I made a launcher made out of salvaged parts that propels a plastic soda bottle that is primed with alcohol (alcohol hand sanitiser).

## Engineering Description:

The launcher device consists of three parts: 

- _Spark generation_
- _Activation switch_
- _Barrel_

### 1. Spark generation:

The Spark generator consists of a high-voltage DC generator salvaged from a mosquito repellant bat, which is inputted with 5V using BEC on a brushless motor ESC which in turn is powered by a 12V battery.

The high voltage is carried into the combustion area via 2 wires through a PVC pipe with dimensions such that it tightly fits the opening of the soda bottle (projectile).

### 2. Activation switch:

The switch which activates the spark generator is made by making wire ends connect physically using a servo motor controlled using a Drone RC remote via Rc receiver so that the user gets to a safe distance and activate the system; all components are powered by the BEC of ESC connected to a 12V battery.

### 3. Barrel:

Barrel is made of a cardboard box made with the exact dimensions of the bottle lined from the inside with aluminium foil to prevent damage by the hot gasses coming out of the bottle's mouth.

_This project was solely made by [me](https://github.com/ChiragKotian) as a fun project to make use of leftover alcohol-based sanitisers after the pandemic._
